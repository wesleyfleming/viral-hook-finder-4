4. **Commit changes**
5. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for Netlify to redeploy

### Option 3: Redeploy Everything via Drag & Drop

Sometimes the easiest fix is to redeploy:

1. **Delete your current Netlify site** (optional, but clean)
2. **Go to app.netlify.com/drop**
3. **Drag your entire folder** with this structure:
```
   viral-hook-finder/
   ├── index.html
   ├── styles.css
   ├── script.js
   ├── netlify.toml
   └── netlify/
       └── functions/
           ├── search-hooks.js
           └── log-search.js
